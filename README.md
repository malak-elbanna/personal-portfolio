# Personal Portfolio

Check my portfolio [@malakelbanna](https://malakelbanna.netlify.app/)

My portfolio is built using React.js and a range of its libraries, including react-bootstrap, to create a sleek and interactive experience.

What can you expect to find in my portfolio? Well, it showcases a diverse set of skills and projects that I've worked on. From web development to UI/UX design, I've poured my passion into every aspect. Additionally, I've included a collection of my original poems. So, if you have a moment, I hope you'll enjoy reading them!
